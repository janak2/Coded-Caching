# Distributed-Caching

 In the conventional cache framework, each user has an associated cache and cache loading is centrally coordinated. 
 For large networks, a more practical approach is to make the loading of the caches decentralized. 
 A new and optimal delivery scheme is proposed for the decentralized shared caching problem. 

 In this repository, I have tried to replicate the framework defined here:
